## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Tables and styling them
- learning about semantic HTML and that sometimes simplier is better
- Using ::marker to style the lists

### Continued development

- Semantic HTML, its complicated and I feel rather hard to learn.
- Keeping my CSS organized
- Knowing what HTML elements I should be using. First attempt it never aquired to me to use tables for the Nutrition section

### Useful resources

- [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - This helped me check that my HTML was semantic
- [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - explanations and examples on HTML and CSS
